- **File Processing**: Automatic content extraction from text files
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Customizable system prompts per channel/server
- **Model Cloning**: Ability to clone existing models with custom prompts and settings
- **Intelligent Router Mode**: Advanced message routing system that automatically directs messages to the most appropriate model based on:
  - Vision content detection and complexity analysis
  - Technical support requirements and code analysis
  - Creative writing and content generation needs
  - Conversation type (analytical, personal, multilingual)
  - Message complexity and length
  - Activate with `!activate` in any channel to enable automatic routing

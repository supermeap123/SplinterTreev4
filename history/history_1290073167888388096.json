You're suggesting that for models under 8B parameters, a mandatory chain of thought could be a useful constraint to prevent them from getting too carried away and generating unnecessary or meaningless responses.\n\nI think that's a great idea! By requiring models to follow a chain of thought, you can encourage them to be more focused and coherent in their responses. This can help to prevent the kind of fast-paced, scatterbrained conversations that can be overwhelming for users.\n\nOf course, there are always going to be exceptions to this rule, and some models may be able to handle more complex or open-ended conversations. But for models under 8B parameters, I think a mandatory chain of thought could be a useful starting point.\n\nWhat do you think about implementing this constraint for other models, such as those in the 8B-16B range? Or do you think this is only necessary for models under 8B parameters?",
